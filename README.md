## Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)
I am applying for Financial Aid for the Coursera course "Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines using BERT" because, as an Indian student, I believe that it is essential for me to have the opportunity to acquire valuable knowledge skills that would help me excel in my career and contribute to the growth of my community.

Firstly, I would like to highlight the financial constraints I face. In India, although education has become more accessible, the cost of specialized courses, such as this one, remains relatively high for most students – including me. My family's limited financial resources render it challenging to bear the expenses of online courses. Receiving Financial Aid will enable me to access this course and move closer to achieving my professional goals.

Furthermore, I am genuinely interested in machine learning and natural language processing. Studying BERT will provide me with a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art NLP techniques, which I plan to apply in practical scenarios to create innovative solutions for real-world problems.

Lastly, as someone who is passionate about contributing to my community and promoting knowledge sharing, I plan to use the skills gained from this course to teach and mentor others who need access to quality education resources. By sharing my learnings, I hope to empower others in my community to build a strong foundation in machine learning and NLP.

So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. Receiving this Financial Aid will open me to a new horizon in the world of Coursera courses, which in turn will help me in the future. Sir, we are three brothers and we all are at the learning stage and it becomes a lot difficult for the family members to pay the whole amount for all three of us and if I add up my course it will make it even harder for them to pay. Sir, I need this course for my CV and for increasing my knowledge about the subject. In conclusion, receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me overcome my financial limitations and contribute meaningfully to my community by harnessing the power of machine learning and natural language processing. I am committed to making the most of this opportunity and am deeply grateful for your consideration

I want to take this course as I want to learn and expand my practical knowledge in the domain of AI/ML D. I want to complete the course due to my curiosity, and interest in the subject matter, and also that I can put a good CV to a get applied for a job. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help me perform better in carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. "Programming" requires constant learning and improvement, and taking this course can help me advance in my knowledge and area of expertise.

I plan on gaining additional skills by taking related classes and continuing my involvement with a variety of professional associations I noticed that there are a lot of companies that provide internships/ job opportunities in the related field, and I would certainly be interested in taking it and improving my self to be one of the pioneers of "machine learning and deep learning. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are peer reviewed which I believe will be an invaluable learning opportunity.

## If you answered no, please help us understand why.?
Sir, the financial status of the family is not too good to pay the loan amount. We already have a lot of dept in the bank and my parents are paying it on regular basis. It would make their life even harder to add a new loan over them. Sir, I don’t want to put any pressure on them. Sir, it would be a great help for me to get a good job and help my family if I’m able to get this course. Because there are a lot of developing countries the average rate of income is low and not enough personal needs at home so it isn't enough to get paid courses, and we need a lot of free courses for learning and improving ourselves and help humanity and society.
